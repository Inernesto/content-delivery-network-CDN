# content-delivery-network-CDN
This is a content-delivery-network (CDN) using the python programing language.

I have created the controller, origin server and replica servers with basic tools
and used postman to send and retrieve videos. 
I tried using Nginx to enable http 2 but had a few problems
No other tools have been used.
